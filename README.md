Node.js Fundamentals – Raw Node.js Project

This repository contains my practice and first project using raw Node.js (without Express).
The goal of this project was to understand how Node.js works under the hood while building a simple UI design that dynamically loads data.

......................................................................................
📚 What I Learned

Basics of Node.js runtime

How the event loop and asynchronous operations work

Working with core modules like http, fs, and path

Serving HTML/CSS files without any frameworks

Loading and injecting data into a UI design using raw Node.js

Understanding the difference between raw Node.js servers and frameworks like Express

......................................................................................

🛠️ Project Overview

Built a simple UI design (HTML + CSS)

Used Node.js to:

Serve static files

Load and display data dynamically

Handle basic routing without Express

Focused on grasping Node.js fundamentals before moving to advanced frameworks

🏆 Learning Outcome

By completing this project, I:

Gained a deeper understanding of how Node.js works internally

Learned to create a basic server without Express

Successfully built a UI design powered by data from Node.js

📌 Next Steps

Explore more routing and templating in raw Node.js

Transition into Express.js and MongoDB/Mongoose for larger applications
